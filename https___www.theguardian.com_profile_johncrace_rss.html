What he really meant was that the Tories would lose between 500 and 600 seats and he would be able to take to the airwaves and crow about his party having done far better than anyone imagined. The plucky Conservatives yet again seizing triumph from a potential disaster. And it would all be down to him and <a href="https://twitter.com/JAHeale/status/1638253096273866784">his idiotic tweets of a 13-year-old Liam Byrne gag</a>.
