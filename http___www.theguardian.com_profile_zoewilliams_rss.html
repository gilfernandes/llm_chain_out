And does that feel like failure or success?</p><p>In the garden of a cafe in the middle of her Brighton Pavilion constituency, Caroline Lucas is eight hours into her bombshell day: the country’s only Green MP has just announced that she won’t stand again for election. She went from a squeaky, 1,200, didn’t-see-that-coming majority in 2010 to a don’t-bother-counting-them almost 20,000 majority in 2019, and has ascended to that very rare status with many of her constituents: it doesn’t matter whether or not you agree with her, you vote for her anyway. It would be rude not to: she works so hard and makes so much sense.</p><p>She has the very short hair of a person who doesn’t have time for hair, estimates that she works “75 or 80 hours a week” and looks harried but undefeated.

      <td><p>We all know what a sweet tooth is, but some people also hanker for salt. Here’s what to do if you can’t stop dreaming of crisps</p><p>Is there any such thing as a “salt tooth”? We are familiar with a sweet tooth, and sugar cravings, along with the negative effects of those. We are broadly aware of the downsides of too much salt, including high blood pressure, which puts pressure on the blood vessels, the heart and the kidneys. It can also lead to water retention. The British Heart Foundation <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/-/media/files/what-we-do/influencing-change/healthlumensalt2022/bhf-salt-report-22.pdf?rev=04e38b527bd544e1b94aef7fbf767da2&amp;hash=0E6FC5772972EE976CDD854CA34892DD">concluded last year</a> that if everyone brought their consumption down to the World Health Organization salt limit of 5g a day by 2030, the result would be up to 1.4m fewer new cases of high blood pressure, 135,000 fewer new cases of coronary heart disease, up to 49,000 fewer new cases of stroke and more than 450,000 extra years in good health.</p><p>But salt is not considered a dietary luxury, even though 40% of people, <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2023/may/four-in-five-dont-know-recommended-maximum-daily-salt-intake">according to a YouGov poll</a>, would put crisps way above chocolate in the treat hierarchy.

He describes running rings around members of the House of Lords and using satire to bring down the government</p><p>Henry Morris should look a lot more stressed than he does, though it’s true that this is the first time I’ve met him (over Zoom), and he has such confident hair that it would be hard to see uncertainty beneath it. “Everyone seems to be preoccupied with my mullet,” he agrees. His wife, Ellie, is two days past her due date so their second child could show up at any minute. Into that happy but high-stakes scene, Morris dropped a hand grenade last Wednesday: a video revealing that the Secret Tory, a Twitter account lampooning Conservatives from a thousand directions, has been him all along.</p><p>Since its inception in 2019, the account – which now has nearly 200,000 followers – has been the focus of magnetised speculation: “Retired anonymous Conservative MP, part-time arms dealer” was how he described himself, though everyone knew that wasn’t <em>real</em>-real. He would tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/secrettory12/status/1582456666678734849">imagined WhatsApp messages between ministers</a>, Alice in Wonderland fantasias that disappeared into the wilds of Liz Truss’s ignorance and Jacob Rees-Mogg’s creepiness. Or he would write <a href="https://twitter.com/secrettory12/status/1295611575433338881">accounts of Conservative chaos</a> in the style of Swift or Chaucer. Nobody was in any doubt that it was parody, but somehow, between the dense and granular detail, and the playful, insidery tone, people thought he was very close to the action; a special adviser, maybe? At the very least, Westminster-bubble-based. Lots of Conservative MPs were following him on Twitter; people started to slide into his DMs to congratulate him on a point well landed, or make suggestions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/the-secret-tory-unmasked-my-one-objective-to-destroy-the-tories">Continue reading...</a></td>

The footage is disgusting and has ruined his algorithm</p><p>I’ve worked pretty hard to ban the use of Facebook in the household, not because of the threat it poses to democracy, nor because I’m worried about privacy or data or whatnot, but because it makes us look old. The kids don’t use it, obviously, because they’re not old. Mr Z has historically been susceptible to “six years ago today” nostalgia jags, and posting pictures of us on holiday that make it look as though everyone’s getting on better than they are. I’ve worked pretty hard to stamp that out, and if nixing Facebook means we miss the odd event of other people who are also old, I’m OK with that.</p><p>What I can’t do is stop him watching food videos. It is a very distinct genre; I don’t know how you’d land on it by accident, except maybe if you typed into Google “the most disgusting thing anyone’s ever eaten”. A guy, often with only his arms visible, probably with sleeve tattoos, will get a gigantic piece of meat and fashion it into an unnatural shape, usually a rectangle. Then he’ll layer it into a tower, spliced with cheese, and wrap it in more meat. Somehow egg yolks will get involved, then additional cheese. It’s all a bit sped up, and mesmerising. I don’t know where the suspense comes from – what could it possibly taste like? Who would ever eat it? Why did an animal – sorry, eight animals – have to die for this? When is karma going to get involved and exact some retribution upon the mozzarella dude? These questions are never answered.

I thought I had escaped the worst of it with my children, but I now realise I was wrong</p><p>In September 2013, I thought I was the most intelligent person ever to exist. By some masterstroke of family planning, I’d managed to have two children, spaced almost two years apart, but because the first was born in September and the second August, they were in adjacent school years. By my calculations, I’d saved two whole years of childcare, which back then was more expensive than the mortgage, but only because at that point Liz Truss was still in charge of childcare costs, and had yet to screw with everyone’s mortgage. And it wasn’t even intentional, my miracle! I was a genius at the level of the ovary.</p><p>Obviously, I hadn’t really thought through what the consequences would be, once they hit the meaningful-exam stage of life, which they still haven’t – at the moment I’m just observing other people. GCSE and A-level events are objectively weird for a household whatever its composition, because for the first time, the kid’s day has the highest stakes. You can pretend this is true for the preceding decade – big day, darling, you’re the narrator in Sinbad the Sailor and yes it <em>is </em>a big deal whether you get the crabs and the dancing squid in the right order – but now it is real. It doesn’t matter what your job is, whole human lives could be hanging off your performance; you still won’t come anywhere near the singular tightrope of the exam, that absolutely atomised space where you’re not allowed to ask for help, you can’t take a little more time, and you’ll be judged on the outcome, indeed that is all you’ll be judged on, until such time as you achieve anything else, which could be never.</p><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/exam-season-makes-everyone-unhappy-why-do-we-put-up-with-it">Continue reading...</a></td>

But even knowing it inside out, I was still surprised to find that it actually existed, that anyone lives like that. You enter through a porch into a massive boot room, where everyone in the family has a floor-to-ceiling locker, stencilled with their name, which is what, I guess, contributes to the incredible sense of order, the un-stately-home tidiness. The rolling view from the dining room windows is enough to make you drop to your knees in quasi-religious thanksgiving. “Sometimes I have the doors open and think: ‘This is actually not real,’” she says. “This is like a holiday camp.” Even her dogs, who caper into the high-ceilinged drawing room, oblivious to how charming sitting on that Chesterfield is going to make them look, are perfect.</p><p>Beeny has adapted seamlessly to the dress code of The Simple Life (the title of her book about this escapade, published this August); she’s a jeans and shirt and (probably, when she’s going outdoors) wellies person now, after more than two decades of her distinctive, rock-chick-goes-to-a-meeting-with-the-bank-manager style.

      <td><p>Comedians will say anything for a laugh – and I’ve given her years of material</p><p>Two years ago, my sister was about to turn 50 and I called her spouse to see what he was getting her. He rattled off a number of ideas so catastrophically bad that I was silenced, unable to find the words for how badly he’d erred. He’d booked her a number of short courses, and got her flute repaired so that she could start playing again, having given up in the late 80s. There are two things that my sister absolutely hates, to the point of phobia: one is slugs, and the other is self-improvement. I genuinely thought she might leave him, but figured 50 was young enough for a second act.</p><p>It turned out he was right and I was wrong: she is now a member of an orchestra. Running the numbers, he’s lived with her for almost twice as long as I did (they were teenage sweethearts), so I should have considered the possibility that he knew a thing or two. A standup comedy course was even more successful than the flute. She really liked it. She still does it. She’s very funny and, more to the point, incredibly agile. All her material is savage about people she knows well, so if, for instance, she looks out and sees her Mr in the audience, she has to ditch that set immediately and revert to the one in which she destroys her own children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/16/i-am-an-inspiration-to-my-sister-unfortunately-what-ive-inspired-is-a-standup-routine">Continue reading...</a></td>

In the hands of a banker or, for that matter, a regular politician, it would be full of black and white tiles and plantation blinds, but in the hands of the Daveys it looks like an 80s novel, full of elegant chaos, every surface covered in papers, cellos and vests.</p><p>The Liberal Democrat leader, 57, is unusually open and approachable, guileless; I start bombarding him with the kind of questions you’d ask a friend you hadn’t seen in 20 years. Why have you got a high chair, when your youngest is nine? How come you’ve got so many cars? Two of the cars are theirs, a little electric one and a mobility vehicle for their 15-year-old son, John, who’s disabled; one car is John’s carer’s, and she has a toddler, hence the high chair. One is John’s teacher’s – “he’s taught from home. We tried two special schools, but they didn’t work out. When we started home education, he was non-verbal. He’s now verbal. Which is brilliant,” he beams.
