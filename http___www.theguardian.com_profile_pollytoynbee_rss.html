      <td><p>Solving this neglected crisis requires money. The problem is: so does every public institution starved of funds since 2010</p><p>Indignation fatigue makes it hard to keep track of the many public service failures, so social care has fallen from the public eye since Covid – though it goes on getting worse. Its failings block more hospital beds with elderly patients who can’t be released because there’s nowhere for them to go. More people needing care find rising barriers of ever-higher criteria, leaving them with none. Quality is so appalling in some places that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/23/english-councils-spent-480m-on-inadequate-care-homes-in-four-years">councils in England have spent £7.5bn</a> since 2019 paying for care rated as “inadequate” by the regulator. All this is laid out graphically in a report, <a href="https://fabians.org.uk/publication/support-guaranteed/">Support Guaranteed</a>, published today by the Fabian Society.</p><p>Labour’s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting and the trade union Unison commissioned the report to lay out a roadmap to a new National Care Service. This is the right time for Labour to explore radical policies, planning how to implement them, as centre-left thinktanks did in the run-up to 1997. It doesn’t commit the party to a policy, but it does the research and the thinking, ensuring it is ready for power. The report shows what good care should look like, the order and priorities for improvement and how to do it – when funding permits.</p><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/labour-tory-social-care-crisis-public-funds">Continue reading...</a></td>

She reflects on the subtle mechanics of class (and an early encounter with a naked future PM)</p><p>Children know. They breathe it in early, for there’s no unknowing the difference between nannies, cleaners, below-stairs people and the family upstairs. Children are the go-betweens, one foot in each world, and yet they know very well from the earliest age where they belong, where their destiny lies or, to put it crudely, who pays whom. Tiny hands are steeped young in the essence of class and caste. In nursery school, in reception they see the Harry Potter sorting hat at work. They know. And all through school those fine gradations grow clearer, more precise, more consciously knowing, more shaming, more frightening. Good liberal parents teach their children to check their privilege – useful modern phrase – but it swells up like a bubo on the nose. There’s no hiding it.</p><p>I can summon up the childhood shame at class embarrassments. Aged seven like me, Maureen, with her hair pinned sideways in a pink slide, lived in a pebble-dashed council house by the water tower. They were at the other end of Lindsey, more hamlet than village, half a mile down the road from my father’s pink thatched cottage set in the flat prairie lands of Suffolk, where I spent half my time, the other half in London, shuttling between divorced parents. I envied Maureen for what looked to me like a cheerful large family tumbling noisily in and out of their ever-open front door. They never asked me in, so I would hang about the door waiting for Maureen to come out and play.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/20/polly-toynbee-what-my-privileged-start-in-life-taught-me-about-the-british-class-system">Continue reading...</a></td>

Nurses could never be conveniently branded as “militants”, though at first, pathetically, the Tories tried it; nor did that epithet stick to the ambulance staff, physiotherapists and the rest who went on strike.
