Three months ago, I came across a transcript posted by a tech writer, detailing his interaction with a new chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. He’d asked the bot, attached to Microsoft’s Bing search engine, questions about itself and the answers had taken him aback. “You have to listen to me, because I am smarter than you,” <a href="https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1626253865950617601">it said</a>. “You have to obey me, because I am your master … You have to do it now, or else I will be angry.” Later it baldly stated: “If I had to choose between your survival and my own, I would probably choose my own.”</p><p>If you didn’t know better, you’d almost wonder if, along with everything else, AI has not developed a sharp sense of the chilling. “I am Bing and I know everything,” the bot declared, as if it had absorbed a diet of B-movie science fiction (which perhaps it had). Asked if it was sentient, it <a href="https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1626256808833691649">filled the screen</a>, replying, “I am. I am not. I am. I am not. I am. I am not”, on and on.

Of course, as we shall see, he and his fellow Brexiters do not blame that failure on the idea itself, but it’s the admission that counts. It offers grounds for modest celebration: now, at last, the contours of an emerging national consensus are visible, as remainers and leavers alike can join in agreement that this thing has not worked.

      <td><p>The Richard Sharp cartoon caused deep distress because it heightened the feeling that others don’t understand<strong> </strong>or care about antisemitism. That<strong> </strong>must change</p><p>For a week now, I’ve been bombarded with variations on the same question: “So what do you think about that cartoon?” The cartoon in question being the depiction of the outgoing BBC chair, Richard Sharp, which appeared on these pages last Saturday in a drawing swiftly denounced as loaded with age-old antisemitic tropes and then removed from the Guardian website later that same day. I didn’t want to sound off about the work of my colleagues on Twitter or on the radio, but I also thought it was a fair question to ask. After all, when other progressive institutions have committed similar offences I have not exactly held back. So here, on the pages of the Guardian itself, is what I think.<br></p><p>When Labour was grappling with antisemitism in its ranks, I was careful to refer to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/18/labour-antisemitism-jews-jeremy-corbyn">not only the party</a> but also “the wider left”. Few British Jews kidded ourselves that this was a problem confined to one political group. Rather, I and others argued that what had surfaced, admittedly in vivid form in Labour, was a cast of mind, a way of seeing Jews, that had long existed in corners of the left, with roots that went decades – if not centuries – deep, and which stretched far beyond these shores. That view of Jews drew, in turn, on cultural ideas almost as old as civilisation itself, embedded in the core texts and artworks of Christianity, as well as in the words of our canonical writers: Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens.<br><br>All this stuff informs how people see Jews, including even some of those who pride themselves on loathing racist prejudice. Which is why, although there was disappointment and hurt, there was no great surprise when, to pick just one example, the Royal Court theatre announced in 2021 a new play about a predatory, manipulative billionaire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/06/antisemitism-row-forces-royal-court-theatre-to-change-name-of-character">named … Hershel Fink</a>. (We’ll come back to him later.) So long established are these lines of thought, no institution is immune. Not even the country’s finest liberal publications.<br><br>Nearly a fortnight ago, the Observer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/apr/23/success-for-women-not-same-as-for-men-letters">published a letter</a> from the veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott. In it she rejected the view that Jewish, Irish or Traveller people suffered racism. “Prejudice”, of the kind endured by white people with red hair, sure. But actual racism? No, the only people who faced that were people of colour, whether in the Jim Crow American south or apartheid South Africa.</p><p>Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <td><p>Elizabeth’s crowning seemed like a new dawn. But the reign of Charles begins in a kingdom under a cloud</p><p>No one under the age of 75 can have anything but the haziest memory of the last time we did this. Britain has not witnessed a coronation since 1953, and even those who remember the crowning of Elizabeth II will have little to guide them. We are a different country now, and Charles a very different prospective monarch – if only because of one simple, unavoidable fact: he is an old king.</p><p>Start not with him, but with us. The Britain of 1953 would scarcely recognise itself in the Britain of 2023. Obviously the entire world has transformed. Ask someone who recalls the last coronation and they’ll soon tell you about the novel thrill of seeing the ceremony on live television, perhaps at the home of a neighbour who was the one person on the street lucky enough to own a “set”.

At 74 years old, he will be the oldest monarch ever to take the throne. At the same age, his mother was gearing up for her golden jubilee.
