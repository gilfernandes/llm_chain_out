      <td><p>Learning the full extent of the environmental damage caused by wood-burning stoves led Guardian columnist George Monbiot to issue a public mea culpa – and help ignite a raging debate</p><p>In 2008, the Guardian columnist George Monbiot installed not one but three wood-burning stoves in his home. It was part of a plan to move away from fossil fuels, support local sustainable suppliers of firewood and live a greener life. It was a costly error. As he recounted in a recent column, he began to regret his decision straight away. “Even fossil fuels, terrible as their impact is, are less damaging than the public health disaster to which I contributed.”</p><p>He tells <strong>Hannah Moore </strong>how the weight of scientific evidence now shows that they contribute to the country’s worsening outdoor air pollution. Incredibly, though only 8% of households in the UK have a wood-burning stove, they release more small particulates – the most dangerous pollutants – than all the vehicles on the road.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/feb/20/the-true-cost-of-wood-burning-stoves-podcast">Continue reading...</a></td>

They are a grave threat and must be banned</p><p>If you wanted to kill as many people as possible, deniably and with no criminal consequences, what would you do? You’d do well to start with a bird flu. Bird flus are responsible for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm">all the known flu pandemics</a>: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war">great influenza that started more than a century ago</a>, “Asian flu”, “Hong Kong flu” and “Russian flu”, which killed tens of millions between them. They also cause many of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/influenza-deaths">annual outbreaks</a> that slaughter hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>Once you have found a suitable variant, two further components are required to weaponise it. The first is an amplifier. The best amplifier is a giant shed or factory in which thousands of birds are packed. These birds should be genetically homogenous, so that your viral strain can travel freely between them. Intensive poultry farms would serve very well. Before long, a low-pathogenic strain should mutate in these circumstances into a highly pathogenic variety.</p><p>George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/08/next-pandemic-bird-flu-mink-farms-transmission">Continue reading...</a></td>

Unsurprisingly, livestock farmers are often furiously opposed.
