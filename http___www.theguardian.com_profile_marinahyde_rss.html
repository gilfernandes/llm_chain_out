      <td><p>There’s no telling how many indictments he will collect before the election.

The oil painting in question is not so much an artwork as a lift-music version of an artwork, and seems to hang at Trump’s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey – which is the same place he <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11065855/Donald-Trump-accused-burying-Ivana-Bedminster-golf-club-advantage-TAX-BREAK.html">buried his former wife Ivana</a>, as all admirers of both exquisite taste and private-cemetery tax breaks may already know. Either way, Ivana’s there, right near the first tee. It’s what she would have wanted.</p><p>As for her surviving ex-husband, it’s fashionable to say that anything that would represent a catastrophic setback for any other human being is exactly what Trump would have wanted.

He’ll use it to pull in fundraising, it’ll rally his base, it’ll make every Republican beta – which is to say, every Republican – feel they have to swear loyalty to him. Furthermore, it’s already got him right where he most loves to be: with everyone talking about him. And these are all reasonable points – or at least reasonable in a through-the-looking-glass way, given that to many outside observers the United States passed reason two or three election cycles ago.

We keep hearing its pipework hasn’t been properly overhauled since the Victorian age, so its own sewage laps at its shores and courses through its rivers. Earlier this month we crowned our oldest ever new monarch, a man who looked a picture of melancholy pretty much throughout, even if media sycophancy made it verboten to categorise the mood as anything other than joyous renewal. The country is overwhelmingly governed in the interests of older voters at the expense of the young.

This would be the only conceivable occasion on which this cohort of politicians could be described as bringing the house down.</p><p>Even the sewage crisis has been folded into the nostalgia myths that some find more comfortable than dealing with the present. “I remember as a child in south Wales swimming in sewage,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-65615711">reminisced the Conservative MP Damian Green</a> this week. “Jackson’s Bay in Barry used to be a sewage outlet where we all went and paddled and swam...”</p><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p><p>This June, Marina Hyde will join fellow columnists at three Guardian Live events in <a href="https://membership.theguardian.com/live/marina-hyde-and-gaby-hinsliff-live-in-leeds-585463335597">Leeds</a>, <a href="https://membership.theguardian.com/live/marina-hyde-and-gary-younge-live-in-brighton-587498312267">Brighton</a> and <a href="https://membership.theguardian.com/live/marina-hyde-in-conversation-with-jonathan-freedland-585167370357">London</a>.

As for the PM who egged them on: nothing to do with ’im, guv</p><p>In a deeply unpredictable turn of events – anticipated by only the most casual students of the Metropolitan police – the force has made another howler. Howlers are the specific category of Met misuse of powers where nobody died, or got sexually assaulted, or both. Nevertheless, they can have serious significance. The anti-monarchy group Republic participated in months of briefings and meetings with the Met concerning their protest at last Saturday’s coronation, in which they were informed that their peaceful plans were lawful. As it turned out on the day, however, six members of the group, including its chief executive Graham Smith, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">were arrested</a> before the protest even began.

We seized lock-on devices.”</p><p>And yet … did they? The police seem instead to have seized the luggage straps the protesters used to secure their placards. The force has now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/08/arrests-coronation-protesters-premeditated-republic-chief-police">expressed “regret”</a> that these arrests took place at all.
