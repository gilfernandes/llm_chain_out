In some European countries, that’s already a reality, and Labour wants us to follow suit</p><p>The idea of a clear demarcation between work and life is, for most people, an absurd joke: your life is being invaded, and you have no line of defence to protect yourself. Even if they are thousands of miles from their desk, a worker may still feel chained to it. Text messages and emails can arrive at ungodly hours, demanding prompt replies. Parents may find the nightly ritual of putting their kids to bed is interrupted by a panicked phone call from their boss. Almost as stressful is the idea that, as you collect your belongings to leave the office, you know you can never really leave: somehow, wherever you are, you remain at work.</p><p>Here is why “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_disconnect#:~:text=The%20right%20to%20disconnect%20is,messages%20during%20non%2Dwork%20hours.">the right to disconnect</a>” has become one of the great emancipatory causes for workers, and could be headed for Labour’s next manifesto. For example, Portugal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/18/portugal-bosses-work-hours-right-to-disconnect">introduced a law</a> at the beginning of last year that imposes a legal duty on bosses not to contact their workers outside of defined working hours. There is one exception – circumstances of force majeure – but otherwise, companies could be fined up to €9,690 (£8,400). In part, this is a response to the phenomenon of working from home: in Britain, 37% of employees now report working from home at least some point in the previous week. While this trend has been liberating for many workers, the Portuguese authorities found it could be exploited by bosses disregarding the idea that a remote worker ever clocked off.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/24/britain-nation-slackers-right-to-disconnect-labour">Continue reading...</a></td>

      <td><p>The Public Order Act shows how this Tory government is hollowing out our democracy. Here’s how we must defend it</p><p>Democratic freedoms are hard won and easily lost. Rights secured after generations of struggle – by citizens risking their safety, liberty and, indeed, lives – can be stripped away in weeks with barely a murmur. Such is the fate of the right to protest, which has now been redefined in the UK as a privilege that exists at the discretion of the police. This weekend, dozens of peaceful protesters advocating republicanism – a cause backed by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/863893/support-for-the-monarchy-in-britain-by-age/">around a quarter</a> of the population, or well over 13 million British adults – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">were arrested</a>. The Metropolitan police has since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/08/arrests-coronation-protesters-premeditated-republic-chief-police">expressed regret</a> at the arrest of six of them belonging to the Republic group, including its head, Graham Smith, but it is rather too late, not least because such repressive behaviour has a chilling effect that deters others from protesting.</p><p>The basis of their arrest offers an instructive lesson about how freedom is lost. All six of the Republic protesters were apprehended under the new Public Order Act, which allows for protesters to be arrested on suspicion of intending to “lock on” – that is, to fix themselves to a target. In the case of these six arrested protesters, the “lock-on equipment” was luggage straps to gather placards. When these laws are passed, opponents who warn they will be enforced far beyond their supposed remit are accused of hyperbole and scaremongering, yet they are invariably proven correct. Unless our politicians are completely stupid, they must be aware of how frequently legislation is used to curtail peaceful protest – and therefore we must conclude this is, in part, the intent. Given that the separate <a href="https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/pcsc-policing-act-protest-rights/">Policing Act</a> allows for protests to be suppressed if they are deemed too noisy – protests are, almost by definition, noisy – this reasoning seems beyond dispute.</p><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While today’s Tories and Trumpified Republicans remain committed to defending privileged interests, their driving ambition now seems to be deliberately provoking fury among the progressively minded, much to the delight of their supporters.
